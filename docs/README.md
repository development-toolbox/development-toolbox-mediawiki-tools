# Documentation Directory

This directory contains all files related to the project's documentation website.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The documentation is organized into two main subdirectories:

-   `./src/`: This directory contains the raw, editable Markdown (`.md`) source files for all documentation pages. All content updates and edits should be made to the files within this directory.

-   `./site/`: This directory contains the final, published HTML website files. These files are generated from the Markdown source in the `src` directory and should not be edited directly, as any changes will be overwritten.

This separation ensures that the documentation source is kept clean and manageable, distinct from the generated site assets.
